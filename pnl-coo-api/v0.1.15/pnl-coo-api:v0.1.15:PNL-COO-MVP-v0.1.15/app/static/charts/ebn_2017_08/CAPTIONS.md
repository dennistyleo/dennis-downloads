# PNL COO Chart Pack — EBN Aug-2017 (V5)

## Design choice (why bars & combined charts)

- With only 8 months shown, line charts can look noisy. For governance, **bar charts + grouped comparisons** read faster.

- Comparable metrics (profit vs profit, cost vs cost, days vs days) are placed on the **same axis** for immediate comparison.


## Contents

- Executive Scoreboard: **5 primary charts (bars / grouped bars)** + **5 backups**

- Causality Radar (8 axes) + Causality Drift Flow (flowchart)

- Evidence Pull ledger (traceable anchors)

- Solution Task Force mapping + governance matrix


## English one-liners

- Profitability grouped bar: compares **Gross vs Operating vs Net** in one glance.

- Earnings vs Cash bar: highlights **profit-cash divergence** instantly.

- Cash cycle grouped bar: shows which lever (DSO/DIO/DPO) is driving working capital stress.
